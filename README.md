Auditing of the business Infrastructure

Optiveriance is planning to be merged with PDCL Ltd. The CEO of PDCL is looking forward to a smooth transition and so after multiple rounds of discussion, they have decided to do an audit of the business Infrastructure of Optiveriance.

Auditing on the following grounds:-
1. What is the Total Sales
2. What about the Total Quantity
3. Profit for the said period and the margin on the same.
4. Need to have a detailed Performance LY for any selected Year
5. Comparing the Performance vs LY
6. Sales 2yrs ago for any Selected Year
7. It is important to know the moving average in terms of Profit & Sales.
8. Quarter-wise analysis is also important, maybe slicer.
9. Top Performer in terms of Product and Customer top 7 will give a clear idea.
